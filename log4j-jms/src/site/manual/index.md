# Apache Log4j Java Message Service (JMS) module

As of Log4j 2.11.0, JMS support has moved from the existing module log4j-core to the new module log4j-jms.

## Requirements

This module was introduced in Log4j 2.11.0 and requires a JMS API JAR.

Some features may require optional
[dependencies](../runtime-dependencies.html). These dependencies are specified in the
documentation for those features.

Some Log4j features require external dependencies.
See the [Dependency Tree](dependencies.html#Dependency_Tree)
for the exact list of JAR files needed for these features.
